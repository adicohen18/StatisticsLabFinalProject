# StatisticsLabFinalProject

The purpose of the task is to conduct a statistical analysis of a specific political party in the 2022 elections and the previous election system in 2021. The task involves preparing a report that describes the voting patterns for the party and explaining the results to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the relevant data for the party. 

The course aimed to analyze real-world problems using data analysis from "A to T". It integrated the entire undergraduate curriculum and applied new theoretical methods.

The course and task necessitated the following skills and competencies:
1. Understanding the research objectives.
2. Presenting complex data in theoretical statistics.
3. Analyzing complex data to understand the meaning of variables and their relationships and identifying errors and outliers.
4. Formulating statistical models suitable for research purposes (PCA, Markov Chain, Linear models, etc).
5. Testing the model's fit to the data and performing necessary adjustments (Hypothesis testing).
6. Implementing the model for data analysis using statistical software while writing computer code.
